Author: Andrew Ning

A modified version of actuator cylinder theory to account for multiple vertical axis wind turbines.  Can run with just a single turbine.  See examples in example.jl.

Written in Julia, but an older Python version of the single actuator cylinder theory is also available in a branch.
